# twitLarge
Script for downloading the large version of twitter pictures if they exist.  
  
When a tweet has multiple images, usually only the normal size image is available. This script allows you to download the large version of every image in that tweet.  
  
### How to use:
Call twitLarge.py with the link to the tweet with images you want to download as the second argument.

Calling twitLarge.py alone will use whatever is currently in your clipboard as the address for download.
#### Example:
    $ ./twitLarge.py https://twitter.com/UserName/status/801849397843611648
    
    $ ./twitLarge.py
